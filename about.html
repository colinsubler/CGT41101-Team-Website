                    <p>My name is Viyata Ruta, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Visualization with a minor in 
                        Studio Art at Purdue University. I have experience in UX design, web design, and data-driven visual storytelling,
                         blending technical skills with creativity to create meaningful digital experiences. I’ve worked on both individual
                          and team projects that focus on clear communication, user-centered design, and aesthetics that enhance functionality.</p>

                    <p>I’m Justice Johnson, a senior in Animation and VFX. I switched from engineering after my sophomore year because I really
                         liked the creative and artistic freedom that comes with working in software like Blender or Maya. Most of my experience
                          comes from in-class projects, but I model and animate outside of class. My projects thus far have been done individually,
                           so I’m excited to work with a group to create a finished product. I worked in IT for almost 3 years, so I have plenty of
                            knowledge working with a group of people and problem-solving to resolve issues.</p>

                    <p>I am Colin Subler. I am a senior at Purdue University studying Web Programming and Design. I have had two internships working 
                        in the manufacturing industry focusing on artificial intelligence and implementation of SCADA software. I also have experience 
                        in the full-stack development of a website for a large ready mix concrete company local to my area. I am eager to work on this
                         project with the client and my team and build my professional skills.</p>

                    <p>I am Brian Barnes. I am a senior majoring in web programming and design. I have worked on many different projects
                         over the years of me studying at Purdue including UX, Modeling, animation etc, but I haven't gotten to work on
                          many projects that have to do with web development. I have little experience in web programming, but I am a
                           quick learner and a hard worker so I believe I have useful skills to offer the team.</p>
